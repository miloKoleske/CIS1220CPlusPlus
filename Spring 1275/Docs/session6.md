Nested conditions

    You can use one or more if or else if statements inside another if or else if statement

    Generally nested condition is checked only if the 1st condition is true or false. Otherwise it will not load. 

    || will only run until it finds a true condition

Efficient vs. inefficient programming using conditionals

    Inefficient: 
     
        checking all possible cases individually

        Using independent "if" statement -- will check every "if" -- compiler has to go through all of this

THINK DRY:
    "don't"
    "repeat"
    "yourself"
