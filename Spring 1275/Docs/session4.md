INPUT AND OUTPUT

cin - standard input stream
cout - standard output stream 

C++ streams perform the input and output operations

cin and cout are both from the iostream

cin
    uses extraction operator >>
    program stops when it gets to cin statement
    can also read multiple inputs at a time with a whitespace between them

cout
    uses insertion operator <<


FORMATTING OUTPUT
    iomanip
        on off switch to control how data is written
            setw
            setfill
            endl
            flush
            left
            right
            fixed - write floating - point values in fixed-point notation 
            scientific 
            setprecision
    ios
    istream
    ostream
    iostream 
io manipulators can help with alignment 
can make output all uppercase, hide certain information


escape sequences:
    \n counts as one of these
    key letter is the \ (backslash)


Verifying results
    test case by hand, print it on paper
