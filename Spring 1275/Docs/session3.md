definitions:

Truncated = removed and lost from memory

short int upper limit = 32767

literals 
    a = 5 (5 is a literal constant)

x = 42, x = -42, x=0 are all legitimate

Number 
42
-42
0
0.42
42.0
'42' - character
"42" - string

?? What is the difference between constant variables and magic numbers


Constants don't change, so consider making technical parts that don't change constants
like feet = 12 (for how many inches in a foot)

can you have the same variable name for different datatypes?


OPERATORS are the symbols that will let you do an action to variables
    assignment is the = sign
        result of value of right side = value of left side 
        variables like a, b, c equal the location in memory of the variable
    addition = +
        always assign from right side to left
        x = y + z NEVER y + z = x
    subtraction + -
    division: /
        division by zero is prohibited
        result of dividing by 0 is undefined


Follow PEMDAS in C++, but "E" does not exist 


Associativity

Left to right
    all arithemetic operations are evaluated in left to right order

Right to left
    all arithemetic operations are evaluated in right to left order
